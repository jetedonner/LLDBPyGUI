## Synopsis

LLDBPyGUI is a longtime missed GUI of mine for the open source debugger (framework) LLDB. While LLDB comes with a
comprehensive set of tools and also a C++ and Python API. It lacks of providing a useful (at least for me) GUI as it's
only working as a terminal application at the present time. So I took some time and started a Python GUI wrapper project
that is using the Python API of LLDB and began to implement a UI with the help of PyQt6. The project is still in a
really early prototype stage at the moment, but I didn't want to let you miss the idea of mine and give you a short
sneak-preview of the tool I have in mind.
